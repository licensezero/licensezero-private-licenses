Background

  I have made contributions to the project.

  I license my contributions to the public on the terms of
  either the License Zero Noncommercial Public License
  (L0-NC) or the License Zero Reciprocal Public License
  (L0-R).

  Broadly speaking, L0-NC's conditions limit use for
  commercial purposes, and L0-R's conditions require you to
  release changes to, software built on, and software build
  using the project as open source software.

  This is a separate license for my contributions to the
  project, with different conditions.

  Broadly speaking, this license lets you to use my
  contributions to the project for commercial purposes, and
  to create software that is not released as open source.

  However, this is a private license that applies only to
  you, and to a more limited extent those you're allowed to
  sublicense.

No Liability

  My contributions to the project come as is, without any
  warranty at all.  As far as the law allows, I will not be
  liable for any damages related to the project or this
  license, for any kind of legal claim.

Copyright License

  Subject to the other terms this license, I grant you a
  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
  irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
  derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  and distribute my contributions to the project, in source
  code or compiled form.

Patent License

  Subject to the other terms of this license, I grant you a
  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
  irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer
  to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the project. That
  license applies only to patent claims I can license that
  are necessarily infringed by my contributions alone, or by
  combination of my contributions with the project as it was
  when I submitted my contributions.

Defensive Termination

  If you sue anyone (including by cross-claim or
  counter-claim) alleging that the project or a contribution
  to the project constitutes direct or contributory patent
  infringement, any patent licenses granted to you under
  this license terminate on the date you file the
  litigation.

Redistribution

  You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of the
  project from you, in source code or any other form, also
  gets the complete text of the public license applied to my
  contributions to the project, including copyright and
  source notices.

Trademarks

  This license does not grant you permission to use my trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names, except
  as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
  the origin of the project.
